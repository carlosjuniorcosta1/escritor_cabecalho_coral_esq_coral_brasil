This code write a header based on a transcription from C-ORAL-ESQ or C-ORAL-BRASIL. 

Load a utf-8 transcription and its corresponding header and execute the program by clicking on play/dash button in next cell.
Provide the filenames correctly (with .txt)
Provide patient's / participant's name you want to count words (example: NAM)

It doesn't matter if the header already has "conventionalized / apheretic forms". The program doesn't change what the 
revisor has done. You can load a header with no "conventionalized /  apheretic forms", but make sure it has these fields like
 'Apheretic forms:' and 'Conventionalized forms: '. In this case, the program will take into account just its backoff variables.
